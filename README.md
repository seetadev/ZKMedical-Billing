#### **🔗 Key Components**  

1️⃣ **Medi ERC-20 Utility Token**  
   - Native token on **Optimism**, **Filecoin** designed for **healthcare transactions, access control, and incentives**.  
   - Used for **decentralized identity verification**, **consultation payments**, and **staking-based access** to premium healthcare services.

     Link: https://github.com/seetadev/ZKMedical-Billing/tree/main/Medi_Token

2️⃣ **Optimism-Powered Decentralized Healthcare System**  
   - A **trustless, smart contract-based network** for **health records, remote consultations, and payments**.  
   - Uses **ZK-proofs & cryptographic attestations** for **privacy-preserving health data access**.  
   - Enables **cross-clinic interoperability** while maintaining **patient data ownership**.  

3️⃣ **Web3 DApp with Optimism Token-Gating**  
   - A **React-based dApp** for **patients, doctors, and researchers** to interact securely.  
   - Token-gated **health services marketplace** where Medi token is required for **appointments, prescriptions, and rewards**.  
   - Integrates **NFT-based health IDs** for **verifiable credentials & prescriptions**.  

#### **🎯 Why Optimism?**  
✅ **Low-Cost Transactions:** Optimism’s **L2 scaling** ensures **affordable healthcare microtransactions**.  
✅ **Decentralized Identity & Privacy:** ZK-based attestations on Optimism ensure **secure patient identity management**.  
✅ **Public Goods & RetroPGF Alignment:** Open-source healthcare infrastructure **benefits global communities** and **reduces reliance on centralized health data silos**.  

#### **📌 Key Outcomes & Impact**  
- **Onboarding healthcare providers to Optimism** through tokenized incentives.  
- **Empowering patients** with **self-sovereign health data**.  
- **Bridging healthcare & DeFi** with **Medi staking & insurance protocols**.  


💬 **Looking for support from the Optimism community to revolutionize decentralized healthcare! 🚀**  


### PPT Medical Invoice DApp – Empowering Healthcare on Optimism 

#### PPT Utility Token Deployment in Medical Invoice DApp

We have deployed the PPT utility token on the Optimism (OP) Mainnet to power key functions within our Medical Invoice DApp: 

✅ Save: Securely save medical invoices on-chain using PPT tokens, ensuring data integrity and long-term availability.

✅ Save As: Create multiple versions of invoices for different stakeholders while maintaining data consistency.

✅ Print: Generate and print invoices securely, ensuring authenticity and alignment with on-chain records.

- Impact

By leveraging Optimism's low-cost and high-speed transaction capabilities, the DApp reduces administrative costs, enhances transparency, and empowers patients with control over their medical data.

### Modules

# ZK Medical Billing
zk Medical Billing and Diagnostics on Optimism, Scroll, Polygon ZKevm blockchain using Avail and zksbts with Bandada, Sindri and Aztec

Track, trace and record work orders, invoices and receipts for medical diagnostic labs using zero knowledge proofs built using circom and noir deployed on Polygon zkEVM and Scroll, analytics tools on Sindri and Bandada, verification and account abstraction on ZK email based wallet, and Web3 ecosystem tools on Avail and Aztech.

We are also developing tools to enable tracing, monitoring and recording of medical invoices in a scalable manner across an entire supply chain for efficiency and sustainability and benefit the entire medical eco-system using Avail for data accessibility layer and Sindri for verification using circom, devops and user security. 

zk Verification contract: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x88f4b0c54cb35dd5f834a1603c0b2555bdc480afb9f5c8aa52a27d6e0d64739b

We are integrating Avail’s Light Client features with zk Medical wallet that seamlessly works across key Ethereum L2 Blockchains and leverages Zero Knowledge Proofs for Crypto-transactions and Identity proofs.
Avail: We are developing custom rollapps  using Dymension with Avail DA and and tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely Avail XLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting. 

ZK Email wallet supports operations like sending DAI and USDC payment amounts, zk signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability on Scroll.

We are using Bandada with Semaphore to  signal anonymously inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups. We are also developing zksbt tokens to communicate with Bandada SDK.

We are extending Aztec’s Stealthdrop implementation in Noir to reward users with cashbacks and gift vouchers in invoices raised in case they exceed an expected range or during yearly festivals.

AIops using Sindri: We are also trying to extend the implementation of Page Rank Algorithm by Sindri to prioritize the ranking of actions (pending, draft and paid) to be undertaken on invoices. Proof generation using Sindri’s ZKML tooling in Noir.


# Scroll

ZK Usage for Scalability on Scroll: We are developing tools to enable tracing, monitoring and recording of medical invoices in a scalable manner across an entire supply chain for efficiency and sustainability and benefit the entire medical eco-system on Scroll using Avail for data accessibility layer and Sindri for verification using circom, devops and user security.

# Bandada Semaphore implementation for anonymous feedback reports

We are extending on the Bandada Semaphore implementation to receive anonymous feedback reports by clients, citizens  inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the medical billing errors and incident reports so that they could strategize more productively and do early stage prevention of medical billing errors and incidents.

We are using Bandada with Semaphore to  signal anonymously inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups. We are also developing zksbt tokens to communicate with Bandada SDK.
