# 🏥 MediChain : ZK Medical Billing & Decentralized Healthcare on Filecoin

**Built on Filecoin/IPFS, Optimism & EVM Chains**

---

### 🚀 Project Overview

**MediChain** is a **Filecoin-powered decentralized healthcare and medical billing protocol** that leverages **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, **Optimism L2 scalability**, and **IPFS-based data persistence** to bring transparency, privacy, and efficiency to global healthcare systems.

By anchoring healthcare data, invoices, and analytics on **Filecoin**, MediChain enables **verifiable, censorship-resistant, and patient-owned records**, bridging the gap between Web3 storage and real-world medical infrastructure.

Our vision aligns with **Filecoin’s mission of verifiable storage and compute over data**, and **Optimism’s RetroPGF program** for building open-source public goods that advance financial inclusion and digital trust in healthcare.

#### 🧩 3. ZK Medical Billing System

* Built on **Optimism, Polygon zkEVM, and Scroll**.
* Uses **Circom/Noir-based ZK circuits** for **confidential medical billing verification**.
* Integrates **Sindri’s ZKML tooling** for **on-chain AI validation and fraud detection**.
* Bridges verified proofs to **Filecoin FVM smart contracts** for permanent attestation.

---

#### 📦 4. Filecoin/IPFS Data Layer

* Patient data, medical invoices, and diagnostics stored as **IPLD objects** on **IPFS**.
* **Filecoin** ensures persistence, redundancy, and cryptographic verifiability.
* Enables **Compute-over-Data (CoD)** scenarios — such as batch analysis, fraud detection, and anonymized medical research.
* Compatible with **FVM smart contracts** for data lifecycle management.

---

#### 💻 5. Web3 Healthcare DApp

* React + Vercel interface for **patients, doctors, insurers, and researchers**.
* Token-gated access to decentralized health records and billing dashboards.
* Integrates **Filecoin storage providers**, **NFT-based medical credentials**, and **ZK wallets**.
