### **MediChain: Decentralized Healthcare & Utility Token on Optimism**  

#### **üöÄ Project Overview**  
MediChain is an **Optimism-native decentralized healthcare system**, powered by the **Medi ERC-20 utility token**. This project leverages **Optimism‚Äôs low-cost, high-speed L2 infrastructure** to create **secure, scalable, and token-gated healthcare solutions**.  

#### **üîó Key Components**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Medi ERC-20 Utility Token**  
   - Native token on **Optimism**, designed for **healthcare transactions, access control, and incentives**.  
   - Used for **decentralized identity verification**, **consultation payments**, and **staking-based access** to premium healthcare services.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimism-Powered Decentralized Healthcare System**  
   - A **trustless, smart contract-based network** for **health records, remote consultations, and payments**.  
   - Uses **ZK-proofs & cryptographic attestations** for **privacy-preserving health data access**.  
   - Enables **cross-clinic interoperability** while maintaining **patient data ownership**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Web3 DApp with Optimism Token-Gating**  
   - A **React-based dApp** for **patients, doctors, and researchers** to interact securely.  
   - Token-gated **health services marketplace** where Medi token is required for **appointments, prescriptions, and rewards**.  
   - Integrates **NFT-based health IDs** for **verifiable credentials & prescriptions**.  

#### **üéØ Why Optimism?**  
‚úÖ **Low-Cost Transactions:** Optimism‚Äôs **L2 scaling** ensures **affordable healthcare microtransactions**.  
‚úÖ **Decentralized Identity & Privacy:** ZK-based attestations on Optimism ensure **secure patient identity management**.  
‚úÖ **Public Goods & RetroPGF Alignment:** Open-source healthcare infrastructure **benefits global communities** and **reduces reliance on centralized health data silos**.  

#### **üìå Key Outcomes & Impact**  
- **Onboarding healthcare providers to Optimism** through tokenized incentives.  
- **Empowering patients** with **self-sovereign health data**.  
- **Bridging healthcare & DeFi** with **Medi staking & insurance protocols**.  


üí¨ **Looking for support from the Optimism community to revolutionize decentralized healthcare! üöÄ**

# ZK Medical Billing
zk Medical Billing and Diagnostics on Optimism, Scroll, Polygon ZKevm blockchain using Avail and zksbts with Bandada, Sindri and Aztec

Track, trace and record work orders, invoices and receipts for medical diagnostic labs using zero knowledge proofs built using circom and noir deployed on Polygon zkEVM and Scroll, analytics tools on Sindri and Bandada, verification and account abstraction on ZK email based wallet, and Web3 ecosystem tools on Avail and Aztech.

We are also developing tools to enable tracing, monitoring and recording of medical invoices in a scalable manner across an entire supply chain for efficiency and sustainability and benefit the entire medical eco-system using Avail for data accessibility layer and Sindri for verification using circom, devops and user security. 

zk Verification contract: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x88f4b0c54cb35dd5f834a1603c0b2555bdc480afb9f5c8aa52a27d6e0d64739b

We are integrating Avail‚Äôs Light Client features with zk Medical wallet that seamlessly works across key Ethereum L2 Blockchains and leverages Zero Knowledge Proofs for Crypto-transactions and Identity proofs.
Avail: We are developing custom rollapps  using Dymension with Avail DA and and tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely Avail XLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting. 

ZK Email wallet supports operations like sending DAI and USDC payment amounts, zk signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability on Scroll.

We are using Bandada with Semaphore to  signal anonymously inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups. We are also developing zksbt tokens to communicate with Bandada SDK.

We are extending Aztec‚Äôs Stealthdrop implementation in Noir to reward users with cashbacks and gift vouchers in invoices raised in case they exceed an expected range or during yearly festivals.

AIops using Sindri: We are also trying to extend the implementation of Page Rank Algorithm by Sindri to prioritize the ranking of actions (pending, draft and paid) to be undertaken on invoices. Proof generation using Sindri‚Äôs ZKML tooling in Noir.


# Scroll

ZK Usage for Scalability on Scroll: We are developing tools to enable tracing, monitoring and recording of medical invoices in a scalable manner across an entire supply chain for efficiency and sustainability and benefit the entire medical eco-system on Scroll using Avail for data accessibility layer and Sindri for verification using circom, devops and user security.

# Bandada Semaphore implementation for anonymous feedback reports

We are extending on the Bandada Semaphore implementation to receive anonymous feedback reports by clients, citizens  inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the medical billing errors and incident reports so that they could strategize more productively and do early stage prevention of medical billing errors and incidents.

We are using Bandada with Semaphore to  signal anonymously inside a Semaphore-compatible off-chain groups. We are also developing zksbt tokens to communicate with Bandada SDK.
